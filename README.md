The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana to create filters on her website that allow her website to search for multiple criteria at the same time. Consequently, adjusting the code created on the index.html and app.js files from module 11 was necessary to create, populate and dynamically filter Dana’s table using JavaSacript and HTML 

## How to perform a search

To create one of multiple filters in a web, both app.js and index.html required of having a variable created that keep track of the filters as an object, create a function to update the filters, create variables for the elements that have been changed, and the ID’s that were ultimately changed. Also, it is important to create if statements that help the code recognizes entry users otherwise, ask the code to clear the filters. Finally, but not last, loop through all the filters and keep any data that matches the filter values, rebuild the table using the filtered data and attach the events that record every change on each filter to build the table once again when the page loads
 
In the index file the body of the web was also adjusted to recognize the filters implemented: search not only by date but also by city, state, country, and shape. Every label and input were recorded with the search desired




## Summary 

JavaScript is a challenging development language and HTML is not different. Complex syntax to follow and a lot of details to memorize. Commenting of the disadvantages of the program itself won’t be described on this analysis however if JavaScript were more friendly to use perhaps great comments or recommendations would be added
